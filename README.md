ASSIGNMENT 3: 
B-TREES with DUPLICATES
-
Goal:
The goal of this assignment is to get some practice with binary search trees, specifically B-
Trees.
- 
B-Trees are one  of  the  most  important  data  structures  we  will  study  in  this  class 
–they  are  regularly  used  in  large  database systems  for  storing  indexes  on  the  records.  However,  just  for  fun,  we  will  make  one  significant  departure  from 
standard  B-trees.  We  will  allow  duplicate  keys,  i.e.,  a  tree  can  have  an  unbounded  number  of  keys  that  have  the 
same value.
-

Problem  Statement:
Your 
task  is  to  implement  a  g
eneric  DuplicateBTree  class.  As  is  to  be  expected, 
DuplicateBTree must implement the BTree ADT we studied in class, except that it can contain multiple copies of the 
same key (at times with exactly the same value). This implies you will have  to change  the 
algorithms for searching, 
inserting and deleting suitably. The exact interface will be as follows:

public interface DuplicateBTree<Key, Value> {

public BTree(int b) throws bNotEvenException;
/* Initializes an empty b - tree. Assume b is even. */

public
boolean isEmpty();  

/* Returns true if the tree is empty.*/

public int size(); 
 
/* Returns the number of key-value pairs*/

public int height(); 
 
/* Returns the height of this B -tree*/
public Vector<Value> search (Key key) throws IllegalKeyException; 


/* Returns all values associated with a given key in a vector */
public void insert( Key key ,Value val); 

/* Inserts the key - value pair */

public void delete(Key key) throws IllegalKeyException; 
/* Deletes all occurrences of key */
public String toString(); 
/* Prints all the tree in the format listed below */
}
Your implementation will have to define a node class which will maintain all keys in the node (you may use an array 
for this), and references to all children. The format for toString function defi
ned above is as follows:
To  convert  a  tree to  string,  just  convert  its  root  to  string.  Converting  a  node  to  string  is  defined  recursively.  Nodes 
that are null, are mapped to empty strings. The mapping of a node, is just the concatenation of the mappings of
its 
children,  separated  by  the  key  value  pairs  present  at  the  node,  and  surrounded  by  rectangular  brackets  [].  For 
example, neglecting the values, 


				| 4    |   5   |   16  |
				------------------------
				/     |     \            \
			    /         |          \              \ 
			/             |            \                 \
		| 1 | 2 | 3 |   |6 | 7 | 9 |   | 11 | 12 |15 |      | 17 | 22 | 36 |
                -------------   ------------   ---------------      ----------------


will be converted as:
”[[1, 2, 3], 4, [6, 7, 9], 10, [11, 12, 15], 16, [17, 22, 36]]”


Now, we have key value pairs instead of simple set of keys, we just replace a single key output in the above string by 
the key value pair. For example, if in the above tree, the values were the string representations of the numbers, then 
the answer would be:
”[[1=One, 2=Two
, 3=Three], 4=Four, [........”
